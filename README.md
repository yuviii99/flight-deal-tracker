# FLIGHT DEAL TRACKER

A python script that fetches destination and price from Google Sheets using Sheety API.

It then search for the flights on the routes online using Tequila API and compares it with the prices fetched from the sheet.

If the online price is less than the sheet price, it sends a notification to the user phone using Twilio API.
